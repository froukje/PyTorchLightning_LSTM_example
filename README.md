# PyTorchLightning_LSTM_example

The repository contains examples of simple LSTMs using PyTorch Lightning

* DataExploration_example1.ipynb: read and explore the data
* PyTorchLightning_LSTM_example1.ipynb: Workflow of PyTorchLightning applied to a simple LSTM

* DataExploration_example2.ipynb: read, explore and prepare the data
* PyTorchLightning_LSTM_example2.ipynb: Workflow of PyTorchLightning applied to a simple LSTM and short evaluation

Datasets used:
* https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set 
* https://www.kaggle.com/srinuti/residential-power-usage-3years-data-timeseries 

The notebooks have been inspired by https://www.kaggle.com/tartakovsky/pytorch-lightning-lstm-timeseries-clean-code

The purpose of this exercise is not to find the best models, but to get familiar with the workflow of PyTorchLightning.
